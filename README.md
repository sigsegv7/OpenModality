# OpenModality - A research operating system

## What is this?

OpenModality is an effort to create an operating system (mostly for internal
usage) in which the focus is to be modular, secure and introspectable as well as
incorporating capability based security with some modal system functionality.

## Design goal and motivation

OpenModality aims to be inspired by the architectural rudimentaries of NT while natively
supporting ELF rather than the kludge-filled PE format. OpenModality aims to provide functionality
under a hybird kernel along with capability-based security.
